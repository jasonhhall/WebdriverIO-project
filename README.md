## WebdriverIO Blueprint

WebdriverIO - WebDriver bindings for Node.js

### How to use this project?
    -Install NodeJS
    -Clone the project
    -Change to the project folder
    -Execute the command "npm install" to download the dependencies
    -Start developing!
    
### How to develop tests?

You can use the project structure and examples for reference on your development which uses the Page Object Model.
Take in mind that it is necessary to have a selenium server to execute your scripts. The base project has the selenium server already on the dependencies list and on the configuration files, which will take care of that part for you.
To run the scripts, on the terminal or cmd window on the project folder run the command "node_modules\.bin\wdio wdio.conf,js"
The project has 2 configuration files to examplify the usage of cucumber as well but use the approach that better fits your needs.
